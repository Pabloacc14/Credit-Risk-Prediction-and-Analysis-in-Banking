# Credit Risk Prediction and Analysis in Banking

## Project Overview
This project aims to build an end-to-end data science solution to predict the probability of loan default using customer financial and behavioral data. The goal is to support data-driven lending decisions and reduce financial risk.

## Business Problem
Financial institutions face significant losses when loans are granted to high-risk clients. Accurately identifying customers who are likely to default is critical for minimizing risk and improving profitability.

## Objectives
- Analyze customer financial and behavioral data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Engineer meaningful features related to credit behavior
- Build and evaluate machine learning models
- Explain model predictions using interpretable techniques
- Visualize insights through dashboards

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer demographic, financial, and engagement information, including income, loans, deposits, and credit card balances. Multiple tables are linked using primary and foreign keys.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Model Explainability (SHAP)
- Power BI (DAX, Dashboards)
- SQL (optional)

## Project Workflow
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Training & Evaluation
6. Model Explainability
7. Dashboard & Insights

## Evaluation Metrics
- ROC-AUC
- Precision
- Recall
- Confusion Matrix

## Expected Outcomes
- Identification of key factors influencing loan default
- Predictive model estimating default probability
- Actionable insights for banking risk management

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Deployment as a web application
- Integration with real-time data
